        "> British Airways (BA) is the flag carrier airline of the United Kingdom (UK). Every day, thousands of BA flights arrive to and depart from the UK, carrying customers across the world. Whether it’s for holidays, work or any other reason, the end-to-end process of scheduling, planning, boarding, fuelling, transporting, landing, and continuously running flights on time, efficiently and with top-class customer service is a huge task with many highly important responsibilities.<br/><br/>\n",
        "> As a data scientist at BA, it will be your job to apply your analytical skills to influence real life multi-million-pound decisions from day one, making a tangible impact on the business as your recommendations, tools and models drive key business decisions, reduce costs and increase revenue.<br/><br/>\n",
        "> Customers who book a flight with BA will experience many interaction points with the BA brand. Understanding a customer's feelings, needs, and feedback is crucial for any business, including BA. <br/><br/>\n",
        "> This first task is focused on scraping and collecting customer feedback and reviewing data from a third-party source and analysing this data to present any insights you may uncover.\n",

By contrast the same staff member looked the other way to a boisterous group of 20 somethings all of whom had large amounts of luggage. London Gatwick to Marrakech with British Airways was rather disappointing. The flight is just over 3 hours and during this flight passengers in economy were offered a tiny packet of digestive biscuits. No water was offered other than a cabin crew member walking through the aisle with a bottle of mineral water and plastic cups. She claimed she ran out of water and so many passengers did not even get that miserly offering. There was no route map on this A320. The captain made only 2 very brief announcements. When I needed to use the lavatory one cabin crew member rudely drew the curtain as she was sitting behind the lavatories with one of her colleagues – they were loudly talking about their boyfriends and ignored an elderly man who was struggling to open the small door to the lavatory. I shall add that the lavatory was unclean and had water on the floor. One concern was the seemingly casual approach to the safety demonstration. Disembarkation was not well managed either. This route is very competitive and these days one has a lot of choice. I will not use British Airways on this route.']\n",

There is a small business class lounge at Jersey with reasonable drinks range and some limited food. Flight boarded on time but take off was delayed due to poor visibility at LHR. Captain kept us well informed and we eventually took off 50 mins behind schedule with a 20 minute late arrival at Heathrow. Good service from the cabin crew and a bacon roll and coffee served.

We just had one bad experience after another on this route in July 2021.  British Airways (BA) notified us that our connection flight to Nice was bumped from 2pm to 6pm so we had to spend an extra 4 hours in the airport during this COVID era. Their website and emails prior to our day of flight kept asking us to check UK.gov for the COVID rules and regulations for transit through London which said that no COVID test was necessary if we could show proof of vaccine, however upon our arrival at the airport they told us we needed to go to the basement to take a COVID test to show negative results. They charged us $250 per person for a rapid COVID test which was an outrage and totally unnecessary. We could have gotten the test done at a cheaper rate had we known that this was a requirement prior to our flight. Food service was horrible (they served food with lots of cheese to me while I had requested a vegan meal due to may dairy allergies). BA damaged our Samsonite luggage and they told us at the airport that we needed to report this online. We have been trying to resolve this issue since July and after asking us for photos like 10 times, they are still giving us the run around. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n
